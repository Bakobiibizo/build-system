## Demonstration Workflow
```rust
// Main demonstration flow
async fn demonstrate_project_generation() {
    let inference_client = InferenceClient::new()?;
    let prompt_manager = PromptManager::new(template_dir)?;

    let demo_prompts = vec![
        "Generate a comprehensive project structure for a task management web application",
        "Create a design for a real-time chat application with WebSocket support",
        "Outline an architecture for a machine learning model deployment platform"
    ];

    for prompt in demo_prompts {
        // Execute AI-driven project generation
        let project_config = prompt_manager.generate_project(prompt).await?;
        
        // Validate and process project configuration
        println!("Generated Project: {}", project_config.project_name);
    }
}
```
