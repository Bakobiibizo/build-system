## Current Focus

1. Documentation Engine
   - [ ] Content validation
   - [ ] Search functionality
   - [ ] Version control
   - [ ] Performance optimization

2. State Management
   - [x] State persistence
   - [x] State recovery
   - [x] State validation
   - [x] Task dependency resolution

3. Build Engine
   - [x] Build step execution
   - [x] Build caching
   - [x] Task dependency validation
   - [ ] Resource allocation optimization

4. Testing
   - [x] Documentation tests
   - [x] State management tests
   - [x] Build engine tests
   - [x] Dependency management tests

## Known Issues

1. Documentation Engine
   - Limited content validation
   - No search capabilities
   - Basic error recovery

2. State Management
   - No persistent storage
   - Limited state validation
   - Several unused code warnings to clean up

3. Build Engine
   - Basic build step handling
   - Resource allocation needs optimization
   - Several unused code warnings to clean up

## Next Steps

### Recommended Next Component: Resource Management

The resource management system should be implemented next to improve build optimization. Key features to implement:

1. Resource Allocation
   - Dynamic resource tracking
   - Resource limits and quotas
   - Priority-based allocation

2. Resource Optimization
   - Resource usage prediction
   - Intelligent task scheduling
   - Resource reclamation

3. Monitoring
   - Resource usage metrics
   - Performance tracking
   - Bottleneck detection

This will help optimize task execution and prevent resource contention issues.
