## Current Focus

1. Documentation Engine
   - [ ] Content validation
   - [ ] Search functionality
   - [ ] Version control
   - [ ] Performance optimization

2. State Management
   - [x] State persistence
   - [x] State recovery
   - [x] State validation
   - [ ] Task dependency resolution

3. Build Engine
   - [x] Build step execution
   - [x] Build caching
   - [ ] Build optimization
   - [ ] Resource allocation optimization

4. Testing
   - [x] Documentation tests
   - [x] State management tests
   - [x] Build engine tests
   - [ ] Integration tests

## Known Issues

1. Documentation Engine
   - Limited content validation
   - No search capabilities
   - Basic error recovery

2. State Management
   - No persistent storage
   - Limited state validation

3. Build Engine
   - Basic build step handling
   - No optimization

## Dependencies
