Below is a **lightweight** architecture document you could use with your prompt-based build system. This document focuses on the **high-level design** of each component, how they interrelate, and how you might manage prompts, state, and a minimal terminal interface to achieve your proof-of-concept. You can further expand or customize these details as your system evolves.

# ARCHITECTURE.md

## 1. Overview

Your system is a **prompt-based build system** that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to:

1. Accept high-level requirements in natural language.
2. Generate an appropriate set of documentation, scaffolding, and detailed “execution” prompts.
3. Provide (or simulate) a “terminal” to apply changes and manage state incrementally.

This document outlines the **core components**:

1. **State Manager**  
2. **Prompt Manager**  
3. **Documentation Manager**  
4. **Terminal Interface**  
5. **Execution Engine**  
6. **LLM API Client**  

Additional or optional components can be added later (e.g., a concurrency manager, advanced caching, etc.), but this is the minimal proof-of-concept design.

---

## 2. High-Level Data Flow

1. **User Requirement**: A user (or handler) provides a natural-language request for what needs to be built or changed.
2. **Prompt Manager**: Builds an appropriate system prompt (or “Technical Lead Role” style prompt), combining the user requirement, relevant documentation, and system constraints.
3. **LLM Response**: The LLM responds with architecture scaffolding, code stubs, or an “execution task” format that outlines exactly how to proceed.
4. **Execution**:
   - If the user/handler approves, the **Terminal Interface** triggers an “EXECUTE TASK” prompt to the LLM with the relevant context.
   - The LLM then generates the actual implementation or updates to files.
   - The system (Terminal Interface + State Manager) applies these updates locally or in a repo-like environment.
5. **Documentation Manager**: The system updates `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, or any other relevant doc to reflect new changes or newly discovered interdependencies.
6. **State Manager**: Records the updated state after each step, ensuring future tasks have the correct context references.

---

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1 State Manager

**Purpose**: Maintains a record of all current tasks, their statuses, the relevant documentation paths, and any known dependencies. Its goal is to minimize confusion when switching contexts or resetting the prompt.

1. **Data Structures**:  
   - **tasks**: A list or dictionary of tasks keyed by an ID, including fields like title, status, dependencies, and relevant documentation paths.  
   - **docs**: A quick reference of documentation file names and paths (e.g., `root/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `components/user-service/PROGRESS.md`, etc.).  
   - **history**: A log of each “EXECUTE TASK” run, references to commits (if version-controlled), and any notable system events.

2. **Responsibilities**:  
   - Stores short references or keywords for the “partial context” the LLM might need.  
   - Provides a simple API to retrieve relevant doc references before generating new prompts.  
   - Maintains consistency: each new action should update the State Manager so it can produce accurate context for the next step.

3. **Implementation Sketch**:  
   ```python
   class StateManager:
       def __init__(self):
           self.tasks = {}
           self.docs = {}
           self.history = []

       def add_task(self, task_id, title, dependencies=None):
           # add new task to tasks dict
           pass

       def update_task_status(self, task_id, status):
           # mark as in-progress, done, blocked, etc.
           pass

       def get_relevant_docs(self, task_id):
           # return doc references based on known dependencies
           pass

       def log_history(self, entry):
           # append record of action or commit to history
           pass
   ```
   
---

### 3.2 Prompt Manager

**Purpose**: Constructs the system-level and user-level prompts, carefully integrating relevant context (docs, architecture, progress) and following the “Technical Lead Role” guidelines.

1. **Input**:
   - Raw user requirement (e.g., “I need to build a token refresh queue for an auth system”).
   - State Manager references (which docs or tasks are relevant).
   - Known instructions or policies (the “Technical Lead Role Parameters”).
2. **Output**:
   - A consolidated prompt that sets the context for the LLM.

3. **Behavior**:
   - Merges the “Technical Lead Role” instructions with the user request.
   - Queries **Documentation Manager** for relevant doc contents or summaries (optional detail).
   - Optionally, references the **State Manager** to know if there is any partial context (like open tasks or dependencies).
   - Produces a final structured prompt that is easily consumed by the LLM.

4. **Implementation Sketch**:
   ```python
   class PromptManager:
       def __init__(self, state_manager):
           self.state_manager = state_manager

       def build_prompt(self, task_id=None, user_request=None):
           # Gather relevant data from StateManager
           relevant_docs = self.state_manager.get_relevant_docs(task_id)
           
           # Build system prompt with role instructions
           # Insert references or partial doc summaries as needed
           system_prompt = (
               "You are a Technical Lead Developer specializing in Python..."
               # ...
           )
           
           # Combine user_request with system prompt
           return f"{system_prompt}\nUser Requirements:\n{user_request}"
   ```

### 3.3 Documentation Manager

**Purpose**: Manages the creation and updates of `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, and any additional doc files. It ensures each component has its own local `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `PROGRESS.md` with accurate interdependencies.

1. **Functionality**:
   - **Create Docs**: For a new component, generate skeleton `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `PROGRESS.md`.
   - **Update Docs**: Insert new changes, add diagrams or references, log new features.
   - **Retrieve Docs** (optional advanced): Provide partial doc content or summaries if needed for a prompt.

2. **Implementation Sketch**:
   ```python
   class DocumentationManager:
       def __init__(self, base_path="docs"):
           self.base_path = base_path

       def create_component_docs(self, component_name):
           # create "component_name/ARCHITECTURE.md" 
           # and "component_name/PROGRESS.md" with placeholders
           pass

       def update_architecture_doc(self, component_name, content):
           # open component's ARCHITECTURE.md and append content
           pass

       def update_progress_doc(self, component_name, content):
           # open component's PROGRESS.md and append content
           pass
   ```

---

### 3.4 Terminal Interface

**Purpose**: Provides the user/handler a minimal interface to interact with the LLM, run tasks, and apply changes to the local file system. This can be a simple Python CLI or a web-based console.

1. **Features**:
   - Accept user input for new tasks/requirements.
   - Show a list of tasks from the **State Manager**.
   - Trigger “EXECUTE TASK” flows for a given task ID.
   - Display or apply code scaffolding from the LLM to actual files.
   - Show or open relevant docs for review.

2. **Implementation Sketch**:
   ```python
   def main_cli():
       state_manager = StateManager()
       prompt_manager = PromptManager(state_manager)
       doc_manager = DocumentationManager()

       while True:
           command = input("> ")
           if command.startswith("new-task"):
               # parse user requirement
               # create task in state manager
               # build prompt, get LLM response
               pass
           elif command.startswith("execute-task"):
               # retrieve the associated prompt
               # send to LLM
               # apply changes to files
               # update doc using doc_manager
               pass
           elif command == "exit":
               break
   ```

---

### 3.5 Execution Engine

**Purpose**: Orchestrates the actual transformation of LLM responses into real project changes (file creation, code insertion, etc.). The **Terminal Interface** might delegate to this engine to handle more complex operations.

1. **Workflow**:
   1. Receive “EXECUTE TASK” style instructions from the LLM (often including file names, code, etc.).
   2. Parse the instructions (they might be in markdown, or a structured JSON-like format).
   3. Write or update local files accordingly.
   4. Invoke the **Documentation Manager** if doc updates are indicated.
   5. Log these changes in the **State Manager**.

2. **Implementation Sketch**:
   ```python
   class ExecutionEngine:
       def apply_changes(self, instructions):
           """
           instructions might be something like:
           
           # EXECUTE TASK: Implement Token Refresh Queue
           ## Context
           ...
           ## Implementation Steps
           ...
           Then actual code blocks or file paths to write.
           """
           # parse instructions
           # update relevant files
           # call DocumentationManager as needed
           pass
   ```

---

### 3.6 LLM API Client

**Purpose**: Provides a unified interface for interacting with various LLM providers while handling caching, rate limiting, and fault tolerance.

1. **Core Features**:
   - Multi-provider support (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
   - Tiered caching system integration
   - Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Request/response logging and monitoring
   - Cost optimization strategies

2. **Interface**:
   ```python
   class LLMClient:
       async def complete(
           self,
           prompt: str,
           model: str,
           temperature: float = 0.7,
           max_tokens: int = 1000,
           cache_strategy: CacheStrategy = CacheStrategy.TIERED
       ) -> LLMResponse:
           pass

       async def stream(
           self,
           prompt: str,
           model: str,
           temperature: float = 0.7,
           max_tokens: int = 1000
       ) -> AsyncIterator[LLMResponse]:
           pass
   ```

## 5. Additional Ideas & Potential Enhancements

1. **Caching / Memoization**  
   - Storing partial LLM responses or doc summaries to reduce token usage and speed up repeated tasks.

2. **Automated Testing Integration**  
   - On each “EXECUTE TASK” result, run local tests (if relevant code is being updated) to ensure no regressions.

3. **Multi-Agent Approach**  
   - Have separate LLM “agents” for documentation vs. code generation, all orchestrated by the Terminal Interface.

4. **Version Control Hooks**  
   - Automatically commit changes to Git (with the Execution Engine or Terminal Interface hooking into `git` commands).
   - Tag each commit with the corresponding “EXECUTE TASK” ID or summary for easy traceability.

5. **Advanced Context Summaries**  
   - Instead of resetting the entire conversation, store a short summary of the relevant docs or state. Re-inject that summary as a “reminder” in the next prompt.

6. **Concurrency or Collaboration**  
   - If multiple developers or multiple tasks are in flight, implement locking or merging strategies in the State Manager to handle parallel changes safely.

---

## 6. Conclusion

This architecture describes a **simple, modular** system that combines:

- A **Prompt Manager** for structured LLM interactions,  
- A **State Manager** for tracking tasks and context,  
- A **Documentation Manager** for local doc creation and updates,  
- A **Terminal Interface** for user commands,  
- An **Execution Engine** for applying changes, and  
- An **LLM API Client** for unified LLM interactions.

By keeping each piece modular, you can expand or swap out components as needed. In your proof-of-concept phase, you can implement minimal versions of each and evolve them iteratively with your “prompt-based build system.”
