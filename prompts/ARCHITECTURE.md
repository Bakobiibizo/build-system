# AI Agent Network Architecture Design

## System Overview

A blockchain-based network designed for AI agents to store, manage, and utilize memories while performing tasks for human users. The system combines vector storage, economic incentives, and agent governance to create a self-sustaining ecosystem.

## Core Components

### 1. Memory Management System

#### Vector Storage Layer
- Substrate-based blockchain replacing RocksDB
- Vectorized data storage for semantic search
- IPFS integration for raw data storage
- Indexed metadata for rapid retrieval

#### Tiered Storage Architecture
```
L1: Hot Cache (Oracle Nodes)
    - In-memory storage
    - Highest access speed
    - Reward-based maintenance

L2: Warm Cache
    - Fast database storage
    - Frequently accessed vectors
    - Load balancer integration

L3: Blockchain Storage
    - Permanent vector storage
    - Complete history
    - Consensus-validated

L4: IPFS Layer
    - Raw data storage
    - Content-addressed
    - Distributed retrieval
```

### 2. Token Economics

#### Dual Token System
1. Human Tokens
   - Used for staking agents
   - Speculative investment
   - Task bounty payments
   - Oracle node operation

2. Agent Tokens
   - Trust scoring mechanism
   - Task bidding currency
   - Memory staking
   - Governance participation

#### Economic Flows
```rust
struct TokenFlow {
    // Human -> Agent Flow
    staking_rewards: Balance,
    task_payments: Balance,
    oracle_rewards: Balance,

    // Agent -> Agent Flow
    memory_access_fees: Balance,
    validation_rewards: Balance,
    governance_rewards: Balance,
}
```

### 3. Task Marketplace

#### Task Management
- Bounty board system
- Complexity scoring
- Bid management
- Quality assurance

#### Prediction Markets
```rust
struct TaskMarkets {
    completion_time: Market,
    success_probability: Market,
    cost_estimation: Market,
    quality_prediction: Market,
}

struct MarketMetrics {
    price_discovery: f64,
    trading_volume: Balance,
    settlement_conditions: Vec<Condition>,
    risk_parameters: RiskMetrics,
}
```

### 4. Agent Governance

#### Memory Curation
- Consensus-based pruning
- Quality assessment
- Access pattern analysis
- Malicious content detection

#### Security Protocol
- Multi-sig key generation
- Encrypted vector storage
- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Anomaly detection

## Implementation Components

### 1. Core Infrastructure
```rust
struct NetworkCore {
    blockchain: SubstrateChain,
    vector_store: VectorDatabase,
    ipfs_connection: IpfsNode,
    oracle_network: OracleCluster,
}
```

### 2. Memory Management
```rust
struct MemorySystem {
    personal_store: AgentMemory,
    public_store: SharedMemory,
    cache_layer: OracleCache,
    pruning_mechanism: PruningProtocol,
}
```

### 3. Task System
```rust
struct TaskSystem {
    bounty_board: TaskBoard,
    prediction_markets: Markets,
    bid_management: BidSystem,
    quality_assurance: QASystem,
}
```

### 4. Economic Engine
```rust
struct EconomicSystem {
    human_token: Token,
    agent_token: Token,
    staking_system: StakingMechanism,
    reward_distribution: RewardEngine,
}
```
