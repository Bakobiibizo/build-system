# Build System Architecture

## Overview

A prompt-based build system leveraging LLMs to manage and execute build tasks with a focus on documentation-driven development. The system uses Rust for robust performance and type safety.

## Core Components

### 1. State Management
- Task tracking and state persistence
- Build artifact management
- Dependency graph maintenance
- Cache management for build outputs

### 2. Prompt Management
- LLM interaction orchestration
- Context management for build tasks
- Template management for common build patterns
- Prompt history and versioning

### 3. Build Engine
- Task execution pipeline
- Parallel build coordination
- Resource allocation and scheduling
- Build step validation

### 4. Documentation Engine
- Automated documentation generation
- Architecture and progress tracking
- Dependency documentation
- Build process documentation

### 5. CLI Interface
- Command-line interface for build operations
- Interactive build management
- Build status monitoring
- Configuration management

## Data Flow

1. User Input → CLI Interface
2. CLI Interface → Prompt Manager
3. Prompt Manager → LLM Client
4. LLM Client → Build Engine
5. Build Engine → State Manager
6. State Manager → Documentation Engine

## Implementation Details

### State Management
```rust
pub struct BuildState {
    tasks: HashMap<TaskId, TaskState>,
    artifacts: HashMap<ArtifactId, ArtifactMetadata>,
    dependencies: DependencyGraph,
}
```

### Build Pipeline
1. Task Initialization
2. Dependency Resolution
3. Resource Allocation
4. Task Execution
5. Artifact Generation
6. State Update
7. Documentation Update

## Security Considerations

1. Input Validation
2. Artifact Verification
3. Dependency Chain Validation
4. Resource Access Control

## Performance Optimization

1. Parallel Build Pipeline
2. Caching Strategy
3. Resource Management
4. Dependency Resolution Optimization
