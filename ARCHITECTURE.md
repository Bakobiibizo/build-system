# AI-Driven Project Generation System Architecture

## Overview
This system is a comprehensive, modular framework for AI-powered project generation and management. It provides a flexible, extensible platform for creating software projects using advanced AI technologies.

## Core Architectural Components

### 1. Overseer AI Model
- Highest level of abstraction
- Coordinates project generation workflow
- Manages tool invocation and decision-making
- Orchestrates interactions between system components

### 2. Tool System
#### Purpose
- Implements a flexible, extensible tool protocol
- Supports dynamic tool registration and execution
- Provides a standardized interface for AI-driven tools

#### Key Features
- Dynamic tool registration
- Standardized tool call mechanism
- Robust error handling
- Support for complex, multi-parameter tools

#### Future Enhancements
- Enhanced parameter validation
- More sophisticated tool discovery
- Support for nested/dependent tool calls

### 3. State Management
#### Purpose
- Tracks project generation state
- Manages task dependencies and execution
- Provides robust state tracking and error handling

#### Key Components
- Task State Management
- Dependency Graph Resolution
- Atomic State Updates
- Comprehensive Logging

#### Workflow

### 4. Prompt Handling
- Manages prompt generation and processing
- Supports multiple prompt types and strategies
- Provides template-based prompt generation
- Handles context injection and safety mechanisms

### 5. Inference Interface
#### Purpose
- Abstracts AI model interactions
- Supports streaming and non-streaming responses
- Handles different AI provider integrations

#### Key Features
- Provider Abstraction
- Streaming Support
