# Architectural Design for Python OpenAI API Client

## System Context
You are an expert software architect tasked with designing a Python OpenAI API client. Your goal is to create a comprehensive architectural design document that covers high-level system architecture, key design principles and patterns, component responsibilities, error handling and resilience strategies, and performance and scalability considerations.

## Prompt Sections

### 1. High-Level System Architecture
Provide a high-level overview of the system architecture, including:
- Component interactions
- Data flow
- Key dependencies

### 2. Design Principles and Patterns
Outline the key design principles and patterns that will guide the development of the OpenAI API client, including:
- Modular design
- Extensibility
- Separation of Concerns
- Error handling and resilience strategies

### 3. Component Responsibilities
Define the responsibilities of each component in the system, including:
- API client
- Request handler
- Response parser
- Error handler
- Logger

### 4. Error Handling and Resilience Strategies
Describe the error handling and resilience strategies that will be employed, including:
- Configurable timeout and retry mechanisms
- Error types and handling mechanisms
- Fallback strategies

### 5. Performance and Scalability Considerations
Discuss the performance and scalability considerations that will be addressed, including:
- Caching mechanisms
- Connection pooling
- Load balancing
- Environment-based configuration management

### 6. Logging and Monitoring Capabilities

### 7. Environment-Based Configuration Management
Describe the environment-based configuration management strategy, including:
- Configuration file formats
- Environment variables
- Configuration loading mechanisms

### 8. Request Document Ingestion

#### Request Document Structure
The system will support ingesting request documents with the following characteristics:
- Supported formats: JSON, YAML, Markdown
- Key sections:
  1. Project Overview
  2. Technical Requirements
  3. Constraints
  4. Desired Outcomes

#### Request Document Parsing Strategy
- Implement a flexible parser that can handle multiple document formats
- Extract and normalize key information from the request document
- Validate and transform input to match architectural design requirements

#### Parsing Rules
1. Mandatory Fields:
   - Project Name
   - Primary Objective
   - Target Technology Stack
2. Optional Fields:
   - Performance Requirements
   - Scalability Expectations
   - Specific Design Constraints

#### Parsing Example
```json
{
  "project_name": "openai-client",
  "objective": "Create a robust AI inference client",
  "technology_stack": {
    "language": "Python",
    "framework": "OpenAI Library"
  },
  "requirements": {
    "streaming_support": true,
    "error_handling": "comprehensive",
    "configuration": "environment-based"
  }
}
```

#### Integration with Architectural Design
- Automatically map request document fields to architectural design sections
- Provide fallback and default values for missing or incomplete specifications
- Generate warnings or suggestions for ambiguous or incomplete requirements

#### Parsing Workflow
1. Load request document
2. Validate document structure
3. Extract and normalize key information
4. Map to architectural design template
5. Generate comprehensive design document

#### Error Handling in Document Parsing
- Implement robust error handling for:
  - Malformed documents
  - Missing critical information
  - Incompatible or conflicting requirements
- Provide clear, actionable feedback on parsing issues

#### Configuration Management
- Support loading request documents from:
  - Local filesystem
  - Remote URLs
  - Environment variables
  - Command-line arguments

#### Extended JSON Schema Update
```json
{
  "request_document": {
    "source": "string (file/url/env)",
    "format": "string (json/yaml/md)",
    "parsing_status": "string (success/partial/failed)",
    "extracted_requirements": {
      "project_name": "string",
      "objective": "string",
      "technology_stack": {
        "language": "string",
        "framework": "string"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 9. Best Practices and Recommendations
Include:
- Security considerations
- Performance optimization tips
- Scalability recommendations
- Potential architectural improvements
