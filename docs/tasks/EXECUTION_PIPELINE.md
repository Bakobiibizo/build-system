# Task Execution Pipeline Implementation

## Context
The build system has a working state management and dependency resolution system. The task execution pipeline needs to be implemented while maintaining compatibility with existing tests and patterns.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. Task Execution
   - Execute build commands
   - Track command outputs
   - Handle build artifacts
   - Manage resource allocation

### Integration Points
- State Management: Use existing `StateManager` for task state updates
- Dependency Resolution: Leverage current dependency graph implementation
- Resource Management: Use current resource tracking system

### Test Requirements
- Follow existing test patterns in `tests/build/mod.rs`
- Ensure compatibility with `test_execute_task` and `test_execute_task_with_dependencies`
- Add new tests following the established pattern

## Implementation Guidelines

### BuildEngine Extensions
```rust
impl BuildEngine {
    async fn run_build(&self, task: &TaskState) -> Result<(), BuildError> {
        // TODO: Implement build execution
    }
}
```

### Key Considerations
1. Use async/await for all IO operations
2. Follow existing error handling patterns
3. Maintain resource safety with RwLock usage
4. Preserve current test coverage

## Success Criteria
1. All existing tests pass
2. New functionality has test coverage
3. Resource management remains intact
4. Error handling follows established patterns
