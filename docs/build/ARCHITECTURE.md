# Build Engine Architecture

## Overview
The build engine is a robust, thread-safe system for executing build tasks with comprehensive error handling and integration points. It provides a flexible architecture for different build executors and supports advanced task management with dependency resolution.

## Core Components

### 1. BuildEngine
- Coordinates build task execution
- Manages task state transitions
- Integrates with state and documentation managers
- Provides thread-safe task execution
- Handles parallel task scheduling
- Manages resource allocation

### 2. DependencyManager
- Manages task dependencies
- Performs topological sorting
- Detects circular dependencies
- Enables parallel execution
- Validates dependency graph

### 3. Task Lifecycle
1. Dependency Resolution
   - Validates dependencies
   - Detects cycles
   - Creates execution order
2. Task Validation
   - Checks task prerequisites
   - Verifies resource requirements
3. Task Execution
   - Runs build steps
   - Manages state transitions
4. Change Application
   - Applies file modifications
   - Handles rollback on failure
5. Documentation Update
   - Logs task progress
   - Updates project documentation

## Key Data Structures

### DependencyGraph
- Task dependency tracking
- Reverse dependency mapping
- Cycle detection
- Topological sorting

### BuildTask
- Unique task identifier
- Metadata and context
- File change specifications
- Resource requirements
- Task dependencies

### ResourceRequirements
- Dynamic resource allocation
- CPU, Memory, Disk constraints
- Network resource management
- Concurrent task limits

## Error Handling
- Comprehensive error types
- State recovery mechanisms
- Detailed error reporting
- Rollback support for failed tasks
- Dependency validation errors

## Integration Points
1. State Management
   - Task status tracking
   - Persistent state storage
   - Dependency state validation

2. Documentation Engine
   - Progress logging
   - Architectural documentation
   - Task history preservation
   - Dependency visualization

## Performance Considerations
- Minimal overhead
- Non-blocking execution
- Concurrent task support
- Efficient resource management
- Parallel task execution
- Dependency-aware scheduling

## Security Aspects
- Task validation
- Resource constraint enforcement
- Secure state transitions
- Dependency chain validation

## Future Extensions
- Machine learning-based task optimization
- Advanced resource prediction
- Multi-tenant build system support
- Dynamic dependency resolution
