# State Management Architecture

## Overview
The state management system is responsible for maintaining the build system's state, including task tracking, dependency management, and build artifacts. It provides a thread-safe, persistent state store that can be accessed by other components.

## Core Components

### 1. TaskManager
- Manages task lifecycle (creation, updates, completion)
- Tracks task dependencies
- Provides task status queries
- Ensures thread-safe state updates

### 2. ArtifactManager
- Tracks build artifacts
- Manages artifact versioning
- Handles artifact cleanup
- Provides artifact caching

### 3. DependencyGraph
- Maintains task dependency relationships
- Detects circular dependencies
- Provides dependency resolution
- Optimizes build order

## Data Structures

### TaskId
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, Eq, Hash, PartialEq)]
pub struct TaskId(String);
```
- Unique identifier for build tasks
- Implements Hash and Eq for HashMap storage

### TaskState
```rust
pub struct TaskState {
    pub id: TaskId,
    pub status: TaskStatus,
    pub dependencies: Vec<TaskId>,
}
```
- Represents current state of a build task
- Tracks task dependencies
- Maintains task status

### TaskStatus
```rust
pub enum TaskStatus {
    Pending,
    InProgress,
    Completed,
    Failed,
}
```
- Represents possible task states
- Used for task lifecycle tracking

## State Flow

1. Task Creation
   ```
   User Request -> TaskManager -> New TaskState -> State Update
   ```

2. Task Execution
   ```
   BuildEngine -> TaskManager -> Update Status -> State Update
   ```

3. Dependency Resolution
   ```
   TaskManager -> DependencyGraph -> Resolved Order -> BuildEngine
   ```

## Persistence Layer

1. In-Memory State
   - Fast access for active builds
   - Thread-safe concurrent access
   - Temporary state storage

2. Persistent Storage
   - JSON/TOML file backup
   - State recovery on restart
   - Build history preservation

## Error Handling

1. State Corruption
   - Automatic state backup
   - Recovery from backup
   - Error logging

2. Concurrency Issues
   - Mutex/RwLock protection
   - Atomic operations
   - Transaction rollback

## Performance Considerations

1. Memory Usage
   - Efficient state representation
   - Periodic cleanup of old states
   - Memory-mapped file storage

2. Concurrent Access
   - Read-write locks
   - Lock-free operations where possible
   - Batched updates
