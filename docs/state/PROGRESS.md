### In Progress
- [ ] ArtifactManager implementation
- [ ] Build order optimization
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Integration with build system
- [ ] Persistent state storage
- [ ] Complex state transition rules
- [ ] State history tracking
- [ ] State audit logging

### Upcoming Tasks
1. Implement ArtifactManager
   - Artifact versioning
   - Artifact cleanup
   - Caching system

2. Optimize Build Order
   - Task priority consideration
   - Resource utilization
   - Parallel execution planning

3. Performance Enhancements
   - Memory usage optimization
   - Disk I/O reduction
   - Concurrent access patterns

4. Implement persistent state storage
5. Develop advanced state querying
6. Create distributed state synchronization
7. Enhance state audit and logging capabilities

### Known Issues
1. Need to implement artifact management
2. Build order could be optimized further
3. Performance testing needed at scale
4. Limited state persistence
5. No distributed state synchronization
6. Minimal state query capabilities

### Next Steps
1. Begin ArtifactManager implementation
2. Add build order optimization
3. Conduct performance testing
4. Integrate with build system
5. Implement state persistence mechanism
6. Develop advanced state querying
7. Create distributed state synchronization
8. Enhance state audit and logging capabilities

### Timeline
- 2025-01-24: âœ… Initial implementation
- 2025-01-31: Artifact management (planned)
- 2025-02-07: Build optimization (planned)
- 2025-02-14: Performance tuning (planned)
