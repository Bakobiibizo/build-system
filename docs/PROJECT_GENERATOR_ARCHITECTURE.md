# Project Generator Tool Architecture

## Overview
The Project Generator is a specialized tool within the AI-driven project generation system, responsible for creating and structuring software projects based on AI-generated specifications.

## Key Responsibilities
- Parse project design specifications
- Generate project directory structures
- Create initial project files
- Support multi-phase project generation
- Provide metadata and tracking

## Core Components
### 1. Project Design Parsing
- Converts JSON/YAML specifications into structured design
- Supports flexible project requirement definitions
- Handles various project types and languages

### 2. Directory Structure Generation
- Creates standardized project layouts
- Supports multiple programming languages
- Handles nested directory creation
- Manages build and source directories

### 3. File Generation Mechanisms
- Template-based file creation
- Supports dynamic content generation
- Handles language-specific file structures
- Provides placeholder and stub implementations

### 4. Metadata Management
- Generates project metadata files
- Tracks project generation timestamp
- Stores design principles and architectural notes
- Supports future project reconstruction

## Design Principles
- Modularity
- Language Agnosticism
- Minimal Assumptions
- Extensible Architecture

## Workflow
1. Receive Project Specification
2. Parse Design Requirements
3. Create Project Directory
4. Generate Initial Files
5. Apply Design Principles
6. Create Metadata

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-language support
- More sophisticated templating
- Advanced design specification parsing
- Integration with version control systems
