# State Management Architecture

## Overview
The State Management system provides a robust, flexible mechanism for tracking and managing the complex workflows of AI-driven project generation.

## Core Architectural Concepts

### 1. Task State Management
- Tracks individual task lifecycles
- Supports complex state transitions
- Provides dependency tracking
- Enables granular workflow control

### 2. Dependency Graph
- Manages task interdependencies
- Detects and prevents circular dependencies
- Supports dynamic task dependency resolution
- Enables intelligent task scheduling

## Key Components

### TaskState
- Unique identifier
- Current status (Pending, Running, Completed, Failed)
- Metadata and context
- Dependency information

### StateManager
- Central orchestration of task states
- Async state transitions
- Comprehensive error handling
- Snapshot and restoration capabilities

## State Transition Workflow
```
Pending 
  ↓ (start)
Running 
  ↓ (success)
Completed
  ↓ (failure)
Failed
```

## Advanced Features
- Atomic state updates
- Transactional state management
- Comprehensive logging
- Error recovery mechanisms

## Design Principles
- Immutability
- Async-first design
- Minimal locking
- Comprehensive error tracking

## Challenges Addressed
- Complex workflow management
- Distributed task execution
- Resilient error handling
- Dynamic dependency resolution

## Future Enhancements
- Distributed state management
- Machine learning-based task prediction
- Advanced visualization tools
- Enhanced error recovery strategies
